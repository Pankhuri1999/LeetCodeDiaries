MAXIMUM REPEATING SUBSTRING
For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. 
The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.
Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.


class Solution {
public:
    int maxRepeating(string sequence, string word) {
        int cnt = 0;
        string tmp = word;
        while(sequence.find(tmp) != string::npos)
        {
            cnt++;
            tmp = tmp + word;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
