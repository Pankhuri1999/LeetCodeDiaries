POSITIONS OF LARGER GROUPS - 
In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.
For example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".
A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example, "xxxx" has the interval [3,6].
A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.
Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.


Code - 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string s) {
        vector<vector<int>> vecy;
        for(int i = 0, j = 0; i<s.size(); i = j)
        {
            while((s[i]==s[j]) && (j<s.size()))
            {
                j++;
            }
            if (j-i>=3)
            {
                vecy.push_back({i,j-1});
            }
        }
        return vecy;
    }
};
