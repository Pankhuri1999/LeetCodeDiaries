SORTING THE SENTENCE - 
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

Code - 
class Solution {
public:
    string sortSentence(string s) { 
        unordered_map<int, string> vary;
        string temp = "";
        for(auto i : s)
        {
           if (isdigit(i))
           {
              int pos = i - '0';
              vary[pos] = temp;
              temp = "";
           }
           else if (isalpha(i))
           {
            temp = temp + i;
           }
        }
        string sen = "";
        for (int i = 1; i<=vary.size(); i++)
        {
            sen = sen + vary[i] + " ";
        }
        sen.pop_back();
        return sen;
    }
};
