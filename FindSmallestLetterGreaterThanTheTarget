Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.


Code - 
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        sort(letters.begin(), letters.end());
        for(auto i : letters)
        {
            if (i > target) return i;
        }
        return letters[0];
    }
};
