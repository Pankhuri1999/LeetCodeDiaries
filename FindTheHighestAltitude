FIND THE HIGHEST ALTITUDE - 
There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.


Code - 
class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
      vector<int> vecy;
      vecy.push_back(0);
      int ans = 0;
      for(auto i : gain)
      {
        ans = ans + i;
        vecy.push_back(ans);
        cout<<ans<<" *****";
      }  
      sort(vecy.begin(), vecy.end(), greater<int>());
      return vecy[0];
    }
};
