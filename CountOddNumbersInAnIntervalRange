COUNT ODD NUMBERS IN AN INTERVAL RANGE - 
Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Code -
class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if ((high - low)%2 != 0) return (high -low + 1)/2;
        else if ((high%2 == 0) && (low%2 == 0)) return (high -low)/2;
        else if ((high%2 != 0) && (low%2 != 0)) return ((high -low)/2)+1;
        return 0;

    }
};
