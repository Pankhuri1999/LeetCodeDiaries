HEIGHT CHECKER
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. 
Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].


Code - 
class Solution {
public:
    int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> vecy = heights;
        sort(vecy.begin(), vecy.end());
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<vecy.size(); i++)
        {
            if (heights[i] != vecy[i])
            {
                cnt = cnt + 1;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
