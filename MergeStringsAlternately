MERGE STRINGS ALTERNATELY - 
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional 
letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Code -
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        int n;
        string m = "", ans = "";
        if (word1.size() > word2.size())
        {
            n = word2.size();
            m = m + word1.substr(word2.size(), word1.size());   
        }
        else if (word2.size() > word1.size())
        {
            n = word1.size();
            m = m + word2.substr(word1.size(), word2.size());   
        }
        else if (word2.size() == word1.size())
        {
            n = word1.size();
            m = m + "";   
        }
       // string ans = "";
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)
        {
             ans = ans + word1[i] + word2[i];
        }
        cout<<ans<<"--"<<m;
        return ans + m; 
    }
};
