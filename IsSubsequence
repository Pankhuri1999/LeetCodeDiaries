IS SUBSEQUENCE - 
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the 
remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


Code - 
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int ptr1 = 0, ptr2 = 0;
        while(ptr2 < t.size())
        {
            if (s[ptr1] == t[ptr2])
            {
                //cout<<"1: "<<ptr1<<endl;
                ptr1++;
               // cout<<"2: "<<ptr1<<endl;
            }
            ptr2++;
        }
        if (ptr1 == s.size())
        {
            return true;
        }
        else
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
};
