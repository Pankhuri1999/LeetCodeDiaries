Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest 
points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

            long long db = 1LL*b[0]*b[0] + 1LL*b[1]*b[1];
            return da < db;
        });

        return vector<vector<int>>(points.begin(), points.begin() + k);
    }
