AVERAGE VALUE OF EVEN NUMBERS WHICH ARE DIVISIBLE BY 3 - 

Given an integer array nums of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by 3.
Note that the average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.

Code - 
class Solution {
public:
    int averageValue(vector<int>& nums) {
       int cnt = 0, sumy = 0;
       for(auto i : nums)
       {
         if (i%6 == 0)
         {
            cnt++;
            sumy = sumy + i;
         }
       }  
       if (cnt == 0) return 0;
       return sumy/cnt;
    }
};
